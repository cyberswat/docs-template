# Explanation

Understanding-oriented documentation that clarifies and illuminates.

## About Explanation

Explanation sections provide context, discuss alternatives, and help readers understand the **why** behind your project. They're different from how-to guides (task-focused) or reference (information-focused).

## What to Include

Good explanation documentation covers:

- **Architecture** - System design and component relationships
- **Concepts** - Core ideas and mental models
- **Design Decisions** - Trade-offs and rationale
- **Background** - Historical context and evolution
- **Comparisons** - How your approach differs from alternatives

## Writing Tips

- Use analogies and examples
- Connect ideas to broader concepts
- Discuss pros and cons openly
- Avoid step-by-step instructions (those belong in how-to guides)

## Start With

Begin your explanation section with:

1. [Architecture Overview](./architecture) - A high-level view of your system
2. Core concepts that users need to understand
3. Key decisions that shaped the project

::: info
Explanation is about understanding. If someone asks "but why does it work that way?", the answer belongs here.
