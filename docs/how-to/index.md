# How-To Guides

Practical step-by-step guides for specific tasks.

## About How-To Guides

How-to guides are **task-oriented** instructions that help users accomplish specific goals. Unlike tutorials, they assume basic knowledge and focus on getting things done.

## Template Structure

Create how-to guides with this structure:

```markdown
# How to [Specific Task]

## Prerequisites
- What the user needs to know/have before starting

## Steps
1. First step with clear action
2. Second step with expected result
3. Continue until task is complete

## Verification
How to confirm the task was successful

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and their solutions
```

## Example Topics

When using this template, consider adding guides for:

- **Setup & Configuration** - Environment setup, deployment, CI/CD
- **Common Tasks** - Daily workflows your users need
- **Integrations** - Connecting with other tools/services
- **Performance** - Optimization and scaling
- **Troubleshooting** - Debugging and problem-solving

::: tip
Keep how-to guides focused on a single task. If you find yourself explaining concepts, that belongs in the [Explanation](/explanation/) section.
